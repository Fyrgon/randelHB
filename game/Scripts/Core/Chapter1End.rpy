mc "All of this... It's like I'm in a dream."
s "...I am not finished with the story yet."
mc "...?"
s "The Demon King cannot be truly killed, we learned it that day."
mc "Huh?"
scene scars4 with dissolve
s "When the Demon King was killed, his soul was released... It looked for an empty vessel."
s "The Demon King's soul had been weakened by the battle, it didn't have enough strength to look for a suitable vessel, so it simply went to the nearest one."
s "...The body of the kid we saved, that was you."
s "And so the Demon King's soul merged with the kid's body."
mc "{i}So that's the reason for those dreams, that's how I managed to fight against Yakina..."
mc "{i}...Why do I feel like I always knew this?"
mc "So a part of the Demon King is living in my body?"
s "...{p}No, [mc]."
s "You are the Demon King."
mc "......"
mc "Wh-What? Just because a part of him is living inside me, doesn't mean I'm the Demon King."
s "I'm sorry, [mc]. Your body was empty. Nothing of the boy remained besides the body."
s "When the Demon King possessed your body, it came back to life... but it had lost all of its old memories along with its original soul."
s "Which means that you are the Demon King. That's the reason why you can't remember your past. Everything that happened before the Hern Siege was erased when you were killed."
mc "{i}What the hell is she trying to say? How could I be the Demon King?"
mc "{i}I'm me, I'm [mc]."
s "I'm sorry [mc]. This is why we were afraid to tell you any of this."
mc "......"
mc "I..."
mc "I don't care what you say, I'm still me, [mc]."
s "[mc]..."
mc "What happened after that?"
s "Eh?"
mc "You said you would tell everything. How did I end up here?"
s "......"
s "With the supposed death of the Demon King, the Demon Army retreated and we won the battle."
s "Everyone celebrated the victory against the Demon Army and we were awarded titles... You know all that."
s "Hans brought you to the Capital with him, after all that."
s "We didn't know what to do with you. We... weren't sure of what you were."
s "So we took care of you."
s "At first everything was going great. You were just a normal child."
s "Hans actually enjoyed taking care of you. It probably must have been a way for him to cope with the loss of Eva."
mc "Were Uncle Pete and her...?"
s "Yeah."
mc "..."
s "A couple of years went by. That's when I started to sense your dark aura growing stronger and stronger."
s "But you were still you. Cute and cuddly, more like Hans' son than the Demon King."
s "With your dark aura growing stronger, we couldn't keep you in the Citadel anymore. If the citadel mages found out about it, they would've taken you away."
s "Hans didn't want that, so he left the Capital with you."
mc "He left just like that?"
s "Yes. He didn't have anything left to do there anyway."
s "Because of his weak body he couldn't be a soldier anymore and he had no one left in the Capital."
mc "Oh..."
s "And that's how you ended up here in Randel. I don't know how the hell he found this place."
