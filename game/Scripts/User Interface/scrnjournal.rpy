########## Note for Myself: #######################
## This can be done in a different, better way.  ##
## By adding a variable for when quests are      ##
## finished, you can put the tips for each quest ##
## in a single if statement tree, instead of     ##
## multiple different if statements â€” which      ##
## repeat endlessly "X's Storyline"              ##
